# Media Library

The Media Library provides an intuitive interface for managing your digital assets, 
including images, videos, and documents. 
To access the Media Library, navigate to the "Media" section after logging into your dashboard. 
Users can upload files either by dragging and dropping into the specified area 
or by using the upload button to select files from their computer. 
Each file is automatically tagged with a unique identifier and the upload date, 
which you can edit by selecting the file and accessing the "Details" panel. 
Supported file formats include JPEG, PNG, and GIF for images; 
MP4, MOV for videos; 
and PDF, DOCX for documents. 
For bulk operations like delete or move, select multiple files using the checkboxes next to each file's thumbnail 
and choose the desired action from the "Bulk Actions" dropdown menu.
